## Assignments for the "Machine Learning for Trading" Specialization

This is a list of assignments I've completed as a part of a Coursera specialization in applying machine learning techniques to trading strategies and quantitative finance. 

## Navigating this Repository

In general, I've segregated materials into four categories:

1. `/intro`: This corresponds to the ["Introduction to Trading, Machine Learning & GCP"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-trading-machine-learning-gcp) course, the first in the specialization.
2. `/mltrading`: This folder corresponds to the second course in the series, ["Using Machine Learning in Trading and Finance"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-trading-finance).
3. `/reinforce`: This is the folder for the last course, ["Reinforcement Learning for Trading Strategies"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/trading-strategies-reinforcement-learning).
4. `/extras`: This folder contains additional exploratory studies I completed on my own to further my understanding of the material.

## Obvious Disclaimer

This comes in two parts.

1. If you're in these courses or this specialization, don't copy this code verbatim to fulfill your assignments. These courses are to help you develop knowledge that you may end up employing to move significant amounts of capital (either yours or *someone else's*). It is your responsibility to understand what you're doing. I've published my code and projects for those of you who are interested in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading or ML-assisted investment and who may need a pointer in the right direction.
2. Using this code in any sort of live environment, with real money, comes at your own peril. This algorithms are not tuned for real-world use, and significant work would be required to get them there. Investing and trading comes with significant risks, and if you don't understand these risks, [here](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/what-risk) would be a good place to start. This code is provided as-is, with no presumptions as to its sophistication or fitness for use.
